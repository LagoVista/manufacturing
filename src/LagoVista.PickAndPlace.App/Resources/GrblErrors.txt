1	GCode Command letter was not found. 
2	GCode Command value invalid or missing.
3	Grbl '$' not recognized or supported.
4	Negative value for an expected positive value.
5	Homing fail. Homing not enabled in settings.
6	Min step pulse must be greater than 3usec.
7	EEPROM read failed. Default values used.
8	Grbl '$' command Only valid when Idle.
9	GCode commands invalid in alarm or jog state.
10	Soft limits require homing to be enabled.
11	Max characters per line exceeded. Ignored.
12	Grbl '$' setting exceeds the maximum step rate.
13	Safety door opened and door state initiated.
14	Build info or start-up line > EEPROM line length
15	Jog target exceeds machine travel, ignored.
16	Jog Cmd missing '=' or has prohibited GCode.
17	Laser mode requires PWM output.
20	An unspoorted Gode was sent.
21	> 1 GCode command in a modal group in block.
22	Feed rate has not yet been set or is undefined.
23	A G or M command value in the block is not an integer. For example, G4 can't be G4.13. Some G-code commands are floating point (G92.1), but these are ignored.
24	Two G-code commands that both require the use of the XYZ axis words were detected in the block.
25	A G-code word was repeated in the block.
26	A G-code command implicitly or explicitly requires XYZ axis words in the block, but none were detected.
27	The G-code protocol mandates N line numbers to be within the range of 1-99,999. We think that's a bit silly and arbitrary. So, we increased the max number to 9,999,999. This error occurs when you send a number more than this.
28	A G-code command was sent, but is missing some important P or L value words in the line. Without them, the command can't be executed. Check your G-code.
29	Grbl supports six work coordinate systems G54-G59. This error happens when trying to use or configure an unsupported work coordinate system, such as G59.1, G59.2, and G59.3.
30	The G53 G-code command requires either a G0 seek or G1 feed motion mode to be active. A different motion was active.
31	There are unused axis words in the block and G80 motion mode cancel is active.
32	A G2 or G3 arc was commanded but there are no XYZ axis words in the selected plane to trace the arc.
33	The motion command has an invalid target. G2, G3, and G38.2 generates this error. For both probing and arcs traced with the radius definition, the current position cannot be the same as the target. This also errors when the arc is mathematically impossible to trace, where the current position, the target position, and the radius of the arc doesn't define a valid arc.
34	A G2 or G3 arc, traced with the radius definition, had a mathematical error when computing the arc geometry. Try either breaking up the arc into semi-circles or quadrants, or redefine them with the arc offset definition.
35	A G2 or G3 arc, traced with the offset definition, is missing the IJK offset word in the selected plane to trace the arc.
36	There are unused, leftover G-code words that aren't used by any command in the block.
37	The G43.1 dynamic tool length offset command cannot apply an offset to an axis other than its configured axis. The Grbl default axis is the Z-axis.
38	Tool number greater than max value.
